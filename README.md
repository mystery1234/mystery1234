👋 Hi, I’m **Shaik Ruksana**
🎯 Tech Explorer | Former Associate Product Manager | Embedded Systems Learner | Creative Problem Solver
With experience in delivering impactful digital solutions across domains like media rights, healthcare, logistics, and CSR, I specialize in translating real-world challenges into effective product strategies and technical solutions. My work spans mobile/web platforms, IoT-based systems, and blockchain-enabled applications.

💼 **Notable contributions**:

* Developed a blockchain-based content rights management system

🔧 **Currently upskilling** in Embedded Systems Design at CDAC Hyderabad, with a focus on Embedded C, microcontrollers, RTOS, and IoT.

💡 Passionate about building user-centered, scalable solutions and continuously learning to bridge the gap between technology and meaningful impact.

💡 I enjoy solving problems, learning fast, and exploring where tech, design, and innovation intersect. Open to new challenges in product, systems, or software that make a real difference.
